## Description

We know that if a phone number A is another phone number B’s prefix, B is not able to be called. For an example, A is 123 while B is 12345, after pressing 123, we call A, and not able to call B.
Given N phone numbers, your task is to find whether there exits two numbers A and B that A is B’s prefix.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases.
The first line of input in each test case contains one integer N (0<N<1001), represent the number of phone numbers.
The next line contains N integers, describing the phone numbers.
The last case is followed by a line containing one zero.

## Output

For each test case, if there exits a phone number that cannot be called, print “NO”, otherwise print “YES” instead.
